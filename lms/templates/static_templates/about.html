 <p>Camara Education is an international educational organisation dedicated to delivering real impact through technology by inspiring and empowering a young generation to improve their own life opportunities. Our mission is to transform education using technology to empower disadvantaged students. Our vision is a world-class technology-enabled education accessible to all.</p>
 <p>Founded in 2005 in Dublin, Ireland, Camara has built a proven model of ‘education delivery’ that is both sustainable and highly scalable. Camara is a registered charity in the US, Ireland and the UK. Our services are delivered through a network of local education hubs in Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Tanzania,  Zambia  and Ireland, alongside a resource Hub in Dublin and London.</p>
 <p>All hubs operate as social enterprises and serve local market needs through a sustainable business model.</p>
